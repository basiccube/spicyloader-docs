# Spicy Topping Mod Loader

## Introduction

This is the documentation for the mod loader in Spicy Topping. The mod loader allows you to add additional functionality to Spicy Topping, via "mods" or, for the sake of not confusing with the Spicy Topping mod itself, "mini-mods".  
Because the mod loader itself is currently quite unfinished and in a pretty barebones state, all information here is subject to change.

## Current Status

As mentioned in the introduction, the mod loader in its current state, is... very unfinished.  

Right now only two types of mods are supported, those being mods that add additional objects into the mod, and character reskin mods.  
There are also no safe-guards that would prevent mods from doing something nefarious to the game (or even worse, your system), and for character reskin mods, not all sprites can be replaced.

## Other Notes

Example mods that work with the mod loader can be found here:
