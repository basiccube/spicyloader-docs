# "objects" folder

**This only applies to mods with the default mod type.**

This folder is scanned by the mod loader where it will then detect sub-folders within it and add them as objects. The folder names is what it will use for the object names.

Each object sub-folder contains it's own set of GML files which are the object events. See the GameMaker manual for information on each object event listed in the sidebar.
